			Key Features of HTTP/1.1 :
			
		      1.It was no longer required for each connection to be terminated immediately after every request served with a response.
			  2. The upgrade header was used to indicate a preferences from the the client that made it possible to switch to a prefferd protocol if found appropriate by the server.
			  3.HTTP /1.1 provided support for chunk transfers that allowed streaming of content dynamically as chunks and for additional headers to be sent after the message body.
			  4.Other features that reinforced its stability were introdued 
			     a)pipelining (the second request is sent before the response to the first is adequately served).
				 b)content negotiation (an exchange between client and server to determine the media type).
				 c)cache control(used to specify caching policies in both requests and responses).
				 
			Key Features of HTTP/2

               1.Protocol Negotiation mechanism - protocol electing ,eg,http/1.1,http/2 or other.
			   2.High -level compatiblity with http/1.1 -methods ,status codes,urls and header fields.
			   3.page load speed improvements through.
			   4.Compression of request headers.
			   5.Binary protocol
			   6.HTTP/2 server push
			   7.Request Multiplexing over a single TCP connection
			   8.Request pipelinging
			   9.Hol blocking -package blocking
